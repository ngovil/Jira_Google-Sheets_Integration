# Jira_Google-Sheets_Integration

You first access the google sheets page where you wish to add the script.

Go to Tools => Script Editor...

Create a script for Blank Project.

Delete all the code currently in the page and paste in the code from the thirdCode.gs page.

Save the project and name it "JIRA".

Go back to the google sheets page and reload.

There should now be another category in the navigation bar called "Jira".

You are now ready to begin using the Jira integration applet.
