# Jira_Google-Sheets_Integration

You first access the Google Sheet where you wish to add the script.

Go to Tools => Script Editor...

Create a script for Blank Project.

Delete all the code currently in the page and paste in the code from the code.gs page.

Save the project.

Go back to the Google Sheet and reload.

There should now be another category in the navigation bar called "JIRA".

You are now ready to begin using the add-on.
